# Water_Quality_Prediction
Uses a public dataset of water quality data and builds a regression model which helps to predict the quality of a water based on input features

This project uses data science concepts to predict water quality using the "water_potability.csv" dataset from Kaggle. The Jupyter Notebook file "water_quality_prediction.ipynb" contains the code used to analyze the data and build the prediction model. The dataset contains various water quality parameters such as pH, hardness, and turbidity, among others, along with a binary classification indicating whether the water is potable or not.

Several data visualization techniques, including value counts, count plots, distribution plots, histograms, heatmaps, and box plots were used to analyze the dataset and identify patterns and correlations between the different parameters. The prediction model was built using linear regression.

This project aims to provide a practical application of data science concepts to predict water quality and contribute to improving access to potable water for communities. The code and dataset used in this project are available on GitHub for further exploration and replication.
